# AI Acceptance and Political Orientation

This project explores how political affiliation and ideology shape public attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence (AI), using large-scale U.S. survey data. It investigates not only direct effects of partisanship but also the psychological and contextual mechanisms underlying AI support and trust.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Survey of U.S. adults on AI attitudes (n = 1007)
- **Key variables**:
  - Political affiliation (Party ID)
  - Political ideology (liberal–conservative scale)
  - AI trust, AI support
  - Mediators: perceived benefit, efficiency, technical self-efficacy
  - Controls: age, gender, income, religion, state

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. Do Democrats and Republicans differ in their support for AI tools?
2. Are these differences mediated by perceived benefits or trust?
3. Does geography (state-level culture) moderate political effects?
4. Which factors matter most: political identity or technological attitudes?

## 🧪 Methods

- Descriptive statistics and visualizations
- OLS regression with control variables
- Mediation analysis (`pingouin`, `statsmodels`)
- State-level red/blue classification analysis

## 🧠 Key Findings (to be filled)

- Political orientation significantly predicts AI support and trust
- Perceived AI benefit partially mediates the party–support link
- Political effects vary little across states, but are moderated by tech efficacy

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- statsmodels, pingouin, semopy, graphviz
